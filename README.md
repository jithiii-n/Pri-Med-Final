# Pri-Med-Final
User friendly privacy preserving inference portal for medical images.

This is created as part of the final year academic project for the completion of MCA course. Pri-Med uses a custom designed CNN model for the inference. The inference pipeline is encrypted with homomorphic encryption. Only the output is exposed in the pipeline , thus providing security and privacy to patient data.
